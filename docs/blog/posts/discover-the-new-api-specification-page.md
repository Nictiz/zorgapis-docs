# Discover the new API specification page

**We are excited to announce that the API specification page is now live on the [API Library for Dutch Healthcare](
https://www.zorgapis.nl/){: target="_blank" }! This new feature allows you to easily explore and access API
documentation.**

On this page, you will find essential API information, including the architectural style, version history,
standardization level, lifecycle state and release date. Additionally, you will find links to various documentation
resources, such as the functional design, technical design, or OpenAPI Specification (OAS).

## Early adopters

We are especially proud to highlight two early adopters of the API strategy for Dutch Healthcare:
[Open Health Hub](https://www.zorgapis.nl/en/organizations/open-health-hub-bv-0da6bcef51984346b6747b6e53fdb2fc){: target="_blank" } and
[ChipSoft](https://www.zorgapis.nl/en/organizations/chipsoft-bv-22c4ee5c0ac34a1eb455a29616ab194c){: target="_blank" }.
Open Health Hub has successfully published their
[FHIR Questionnaire](https://www.zorgapis.nl/en/api-specifications/fhir-questionnaire-5205c66f80d24a8fa4af8c01f8de4e20){: target="_blank" }
API, while ChipSoft has published their
[Zorgplatform Workflow API](https://www.zorgapis.nl/en/api-specifications/zorgplatform-workflow-api-ddbcd0f90c4647e38641681245e78769){: target="_blank" }.
By doing so, both companies have taken significant steps in advancing API standardization and interoperability in Dutch
healthcare, setting a strong example for others to follow.

# Introducing communication standards

**With the introduction of communication standards to the [API Library for Dutch Healthcare](
https://www.zorgapis.nl/){: target="_blank" }, you can now showcase that your API follows recognized healthcare
standards.**

This new feature allows users to easily discover communication standards and link specific versions to their API
specifications. It's another step forward in enhancing interoperability and transparency within the healthcare sector.

<!-- more -->

By linking a communication standard to your API specification, you ensure that users can cleary see your API's alignment
with industry standards. This not only highlights compliance but also allows potential users to filter APIs based on the
specific standards they've implemented. It's a valuable way to showcase the interoperability and reliability of your
solution, making it more likely for others to trust and adopt your API.

Don't miss out! Visit our updated [documentation](
../../learn/apis/adding-an-api-specification.md#add-communication-standard-version) to publish or update your APIs today
and make them stand out in the [API Library for Dutch Healthcare](https://www.zorgapis.nl/){: target="_blank" }.

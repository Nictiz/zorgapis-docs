# Adding an avatar to your organization

**ZorgAPIs API
[version 0.3.2](https://github.com/Nictiz/zorgapis-openapi-specification/releases/tag/v0.3.2){: target="_blank" } is
released, which brings a new and simple way to add an avatar to your organization's page in the API Library for Dutch
Healthcare.**

As part of our continuous efforts to enhance user experience, we have added the `githubUrl` and `gitlabUrl` properties
to the `Organization` schema. These URLs will be used to retrieve the organization's avatar and display it on your page
in the [API Library for Dutch Healthcare](https://www.zorgapis.nl/){: target="_blank" }.

<!-- more -->

With this update, you can simply link your organization's GitHub or GitLab profile. The system will automatically fetch
and display the avatar from these profiles, enhancing your organization's brand presence within the [API Library](
https://www.zorgapis.nl/){: target="_blank" } and making it easier for users to identify and engage with your APIs.

We encourage you to update your organization's profile and take advantage of this new functionality. We have updated
our [documentation](../../learn/adding-an-organization.md) to guide you through the process of adding or updating your
organization details.
